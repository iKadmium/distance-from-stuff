# DistanceFromStuff

This is an Angular application for people searching for accommodation or housing. Its purpose is to determine how far that house is from things they care about. How far do I have to walk to a supermarket? How long is the bus/train trip to my work? How long is the drive to nearest Bunnings? Using the Google Places, Geolocation and Distance Matrix APIs, this app can quickly find out.
